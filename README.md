STM32_Embedded-_Projects

This is a package for developing embedded software for STM32 microcontrollers using the STM32CubeMX tool and the STM32CubeIDE development environment. The package includes drivers for various peripherals, as well as example projects that demonstrate how to use the drivers.

Features
Drivers for various peripherals, including GPIO, timers, USART, SPI, I2C, and ADC.
Example projects that demonstrate how to use the drivers to implement various functions, such as reading from sensors, controlling actuators, and communicating with other devices.
Configuration files for the STM32CubeMX tool that make it easy to generate code for different STM32 microcontrollers and peripherals.
Documentation that explains how to set up the development environment and use the drivers and example projects.
Usage
To use this package, simply clone the repository to your local machine and import the drivers and example projects into your STM32CubeIDE workspace. The package includes a set of documentation files that explain how to use the drivers and example projects.

Requirements
This package requires the STM32CubeMX tool and the STM32CubeIDE development environment.
